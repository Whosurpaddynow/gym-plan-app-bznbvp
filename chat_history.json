You're looking for a workout and nutrition app tailored to your gym access, with customizable workout plans, a nutrition guide, and affordable recipes for different fitness goals. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Workout Planner:** A screen where users can create weekly workout schedules, selecting exercises for each day.\n-   **Exercise Library:** A database of exercises with descriptions and ideally, short video demonstrations (this might be a later addition due to complexity).\n-   **Nutrition Guide & Recipes:** A section with recipes categorized by fitness goal (weight loss, muscle gain) and dietary restrictions (if any). Recipes should include nutritional information and cost estimates.\n-   **User Profile:** A basic profile screen where users can set their fitness goals and track progress (weight, measurements, etc.).\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f9f9` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#64b5f6` (Light blue for main actions)\n    *   Secondary: `#aed581` (Light green for accents)\n    *   Accent: `#ffb74d` (Orange for highlights)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White for cards/containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#ffee58` (Yellow for important elements)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" (default for the platform) or consider loading \"Roboto\" or \"Open Sans\" for a more distinct look.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  **Workout Planner Screen:**\n    *   Create a new screen in the `app/(tabs)` directory, possibly named `workout.tsx`.\n    *   Implement a basic weekly schedule layout (days of the week).\n    *   Allow users to add exercises to each day (initially, this could be a simple text input).\n2.  **Exercise Library:**\n    *   For the first version, create a simple data structure (e.g., an array of objects) within `workout.tsx` to store exercise names.\n    *   Later, this could be expanded to include descriptions and video links (and potentially moved to a separate file/database).\n3.  **Nutrition Guide & Recipes:**\n    *   Create a new screen in the `app/(tabs)` directory, possibly named `nutrition.tsx`.\n    *   Hardcode a few sample recipes for each fitness goal (weight loss, muscle gain).\n    *   Include nutritional information (calories, protein, carbs, fat) and a rough cost estimate per serving.\n4.  **User Profile:**\n    *   Create a new screen in the `app/(tabs)` directory, possibly named `profile.tsx` (you already have this file).\n    *   Add basic input fields for weight, height, and fitness goals.\n    *   Implement simple progress tracking (e.g., display weight loss/gain over time).\n5.  **Navigation:**\n    *   Ensure seamless navigation between all screens using `expo-router`.\n    *   Consider using the `FloatingTabBar` component for easy access to the main screens.\n\nNow, let's start by modifying the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user. After that, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-14T07:36:58.468842"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a comprehensive workout and nutrition app!
